# OFB Ipart
A Project for Molecular Multiplex Network Inference

OFB Ipart is a software project that develops computational methods for inferring complex multiplex networks from molecular data. The system combines several advanced algorithms and techniques—including hidden Markov models, multiobjective genetic algorithms, and cross-layer classifiers—to analyze and predict molecular interactions. The repository is organized into multiple modules that cover model definitions, optimization routines, and data synthesis, providing a comprehensive framework for network inference.

## Repository Structure and Components

- **Classifier Modules**
    Defines a set of abstract and concrete classifier interfaces. These include various classifier types (such as single-chain and multiplex classifiers) that use different modeling approaches to distinguish between molecular states.
    Implements a generic multiplex classifier that leverages the underlying network layers and HMM models to calculate likelihoods and make predictions based on the input data.

- **Graph Layers**  
    Contains the definition of an abstract graph layer and a sample implementation (e.g., SimpleGraphLayer). These layers are used to represent and process molecular interactions, forming the basis for many classifier models.

- **Multiobjective Optimization (NSGA-II)**  
    Implement the NSGA-II algorithm for multiobjective optimization. These files handle the optimization of model parameters over several conflicting objectives, ensuring that the multiplex network inference is finely tuned.

- **Hidden Markov Model Multiplexing**
    Implements a chain of hidden Markov models arranged in a multiplex configuration. This module is key to capturing the interdependencies across different layers of molecular information, enabling more accurate network inference.

- **Synthetic Data Generation**
    Provides a tool for generating synthetic datasets that simulate molecular data. This component is used to validate and test the network inference algorithms under controlled conditions.

- **Additional Utilities and Helpers**  
  Other files in the repository (not listed individually here) support tasks such as configuration handling, data preprocessing, and logging, which together create an integrated environment for developing and evaluating molecular network models.


OFB Ipart offers a modular and extensible framework for researchers working on molecular network inference. By combining various state-of-the-art techniques into a unified system, the project serves as both a practical tool for data analysis and a foundation for further academic research in computational molecular biology.


OFB Ipart demonstrates how advanced algorithms—including HMM-based modeling, NSGA-II optimization, and cross-layer classification—can be effectively integrated to infer complex multiplex networks. This project provides valuable insights and a solid technical basis for the exploration of computational methods in molecular biology.
